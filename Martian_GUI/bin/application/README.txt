armageddonIt.mp3 is a 4 second sound clip from Def Leopard's, Armageddon It.

It needs to be moved to the Eclipse Project's root folder to run in the gui properly.

I wasn't able to type out it's path manually as in class with the regular file types, or via string variable whose path pointed to the application folder, without causing a URI runtime error.
